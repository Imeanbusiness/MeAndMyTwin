      <p class = "beotwtext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feya Calaguas has been observed "tweaking" during the week! Experts believe that the stress of Leo, school, her evil twin, or even all of these together that are causing our main specimen to crack! Let's dive deep into our specimen for this week.
        <br> 
        <br>
        Recently, the Leo club out of the blue called back for one of their events to be reinstated at the start of the week, which Feya only had 5 days to prepare for! The stress of that event has added to the state of Feya's "tweaking". This sudden event shocked Feya and continued to affect her more and more throughout the week. Feya has been observed communicating with other specimen and seems to be expressing negative emotions about this event that occured. Experts say that her negativity levels are so high that they are visibly emitted from her body.
        <br>
        <br>
        Feya has also recieved a lot of academic pressure during this weak. Due to Feya's smaller body size, she is more prone to stress and is unable to take even the smallest hit. In the past few weeks, Feya has been hit with mediocre test scores and has been made to work harder as her list of to-do continues to build up. The specimen can be found visibly upset about this in her chamber and general habitual area. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The specimen has also been recieving a lot of heat from her twin, ME! The specimen continues to be visibly uncomfortable every single day due to her twin and has been affecting her overall morale and wellbeing. The specimen is almost overpowered by her twin but the stresses of life make it too difficult for her to properly deal with him. Feya has been enduring more than 2 months of pain from her twin.
        <br>
        <br>
        The specimen this week overall has been somewhat more stressed than usual. Further testing will be conducted on the specimen in the future to determine the ability of controlling the specimen's stress level.

      <h1>TOP 5 THINGS FEYA LIKES</h1>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a top 5 list of things that Feya really likes! Wanna get her something or make her day? This list will surely be of good use to you! This list is made up of actions or objects that the specimen has been observed taking a liking to.</p>
      <h2>5: Being asked academic questions</h2>
      <p>- Feya LOVES answering academic questions, especially about biology! Feya will ALWAYS be able to answer you, and if she can't, that means she owes you 10 dollars! She loves this!</p>
      <h2>4: Smarties</h2>
      <p>- It's weird that Feya likes smarties because she clearly is not one. But she really likes them! Hand her a box and she will gobble them up!</p>
      <h2>3: Comments about her height</h2>
      <p>- Feya needs as much support as she can get for her very short height. Calling her words like "funsized" and "mini" are sure to help her feel included and make her very very happy. Do this everyday if you want to make her day!</p>
      <h2>2: League of Legends players</h2>
      <p>- Feya really likes a good LoL player. This is supported by most researchers of the Feya Specimen, in fact! Giving her a good LoL player to interact with will greatly increase her dopamine levels (and estrogen levels)!</p>
      <h2>1: [Redacted]</h2>

      <h1>Feya Drops a Bomb?</h1>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speculation suggest that Feya recently dropped a big "truth bomb" on someone, although many say that that information will not be revealed to the public any time soon. Many mention that the bomb dropped was relatively disappointing and all Feya got from dropping the bomb was a bunch of smarties. Secretly, we all know Feya is still upset about her current cold war. What is her plan now?</p>
