      </video>
      <p class = "beotwtext">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extremely embarrassing and hilarious video footage of the specimen dancing was recorded very recently! Studies show that while the specimen appears to be elated in the video, this is secretly a sign of the specimen slowly going crazy and "tweaking" even more.
        <br> 
        <br>
        Feya even acted violently against one of the head researchers this weak, "blocking" him without even sparing a thought! Of course, this makes the research team even more intrigued in researching this specimen. How sentient is it really? We will find out.
        <br>
        <br>
        This video is still kept in the research archives. The researchers will continue to use it to comprehend and learn more about Feya, our prized specimen. Much has changed with it in the past few days. More updates will be coming next week.

      <h1>TOP 5 THINGS FEYA HATES</h1>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a top 5 list of things that Feya really DOES NOT like! This list will help you avoid things that make her unhappy and make her day better!</p>
      <h2>5: Professional Help</h2>
      <p>- Feya does not need professional help, even when it comes to her height! Telling her that she does is a huge insult to her.</p>
      <h2>4: Men</h2>
      <p>- She complains about them all the time! "Oh did you know this guys did this", "Oh I'm so attracted to this guy". Do not feed her more men. She already has enough of them in her mouth.</p>
      <h2>3: Open Airways</h2>
      <p>- Feya DESPISES an open airway! Help her close it up and she'll grow red with love!!!</p>
      <h2>2: Being Beaten in Class</h2>
      <p>- Want to make Feya REALLY REALLY JEALOUS? Put in some extra work and study harder! Feya hates it when you beat her in a class! Even if it's only by 1 mark! Try it!</p>
      <h2>1: Getting Her Hair Pulled</h2>
      <p>- Just joking she loves this, try this on her whenever she's sees you, and that look on her face will change significantly!</p>

      <h1>FEYA UNITES TWINS!</h1>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are rumours talking about how Feya got her 2 twins united together! Speculation also suggests that Feya wants to graduate high school with 69 wives! Unfortunately, as of right now, she is sitting in the low 30s. Too bad for our dear old Feya. Here is the question we must all be asking... Would Feya 69 her 69 wives if she ended up getting 69 wives? We must wait and see.</p>
